Cross Domain is the client we work for in the project. It's a big data company focused on K12 education in Chinese public schools. They devote themselves to educational practices and creates products for delivering educational equality in China and worldwide. 

You can learn more about them at [their website](www.crossdomain.cn/).

By researching K-12 programming standards and existing online Python courses, our team apply learning science principles in the design of a facilitative learning platform for Chinese middle school students at international and experimental schools. We aim to support an inclusive programming classroom environment for both students and teachers alike by leveraging educational technology and learning analytics.
