It's a course project spanning one month for the course *Tools for Online Learning* at CMU. We used the concept of jigsaw and collaborative learning to design and build a website for teaching how an induction cooker works. You can find the website [here](https://daniel-zhuwh.github.io/TOL2_induction_cooker/).

I was involved in the discussion of its design and was fully responsible for the implementation of the website.
